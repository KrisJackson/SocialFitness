### Share your finest workouts with the world! 

Staying active and working out is HARD especially when you're doing it alone! Many people fail to maintain their motivation, and ultimately find reasons quit. I am working to develop an app that makes working out fun, helps to boost motivation, and rewards hard work. On my app, everyone is an athlete, and itâ€™s about time that people start feeling more confident in their hustle regardless of their fitness history.

This project is in its initial stage of development.
